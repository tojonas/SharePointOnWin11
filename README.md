# WssOnVista (Updated for SharePoint 2019 on Windows 11)

[WssOnVista was possible thanks to this article by Matt Pietrek.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/march/inside-windows-an-in-depth-look-into-the-win32-portable-executable-file-format-part-2) Later I rewrote it using the great library [EasyHook](https://easyhook.github.io/)


**WssOnVista** is a project originally created in 2008 by Jonas Nilsson that allowed users to install **Windows SharePoint Services (WSS 3.0)** on a workstation operating system — specifically **Windows Vista**.  

This project has now been updated to enable the installation of **SharePoint 2019** on **Windows 11**, showing the powers of API interception for development and educational purposes.

> ⚠ **Note:** This project is provided for educational and development use only, no need to install SharePoint on a workstation anymore. Next challenge a Docker image.

## Background

At the time of its creation, WSS 3.0 was officially supported only on server-class operating systems (such as Windows Server 2003 and 2008). WssOnVista helped bypass these limitations, enabling installation and basic operation of WSS on Windows Vista.  

## Features

- Original support for WSS 3.0 on Windows Vista
- Updated support for SharePoint 2019 on Windows 11
- Suitable for development, testing, and educational use
